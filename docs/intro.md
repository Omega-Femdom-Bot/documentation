# Omega

Welcome to Omega Docs, your one-stop source for all things Omega. Here, you'll find information on what Omega is, what it can do, and how you can use it to enhance your BDSM Discord experience.

Omega is a BDSM Discord bot that helps Dommes control and manage their subs. With a variety of fun activities and commands, Omega makes it easy to explore and express your kinky side on Discord.

Some of the things that Omega can do include:

- Keeping track of subs and Domme hierarchies
- Assisting with role-playing actions such as hugs, kisses, cuddles, and even NSFW naughtiness like *fucking, spanking, choking...*
- Allowing Dommes to add restrictions to subs, like gagging and disabling emojis
- Helping Dommes punish subs with forced written lines
- Offering an economy and games feature, where members can sell, buy, or collect items
- Providing various utility functions for support

Please note that Omega is always under active development, so new features will be rolling out regularly. If you have any questions or need help, join our [Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/5gxgwuHvAN), where you can report bugs, ask for help, or just hang out and chat.
